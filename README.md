  - **JOINs** (`INNER JOIN`, `SELF JOIN`) to merge datasets  
  - **Aggregations** (`SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `ROUND()`) for key metrics  
  - **Views** to store pre-processed data for further analysis  
  - **Histograms** using `LPAD()` to visualize order distribution  
  - **String functions** like `CONCAT()`, `SUBSTRING()`, etc.
